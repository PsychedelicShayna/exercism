## Exercism 
[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is an online learning platform used for programming language practice, in the form of bite sized programming problems (exercises), ranging from easy to hard. The nature of these problems place more emphasis on the language itself rather then the problem, with the problem serving as a vehicle to introduce you to new concepts and language features, rather than as a means to practice language agnostic problem solving like with LeetCode.

My solutions to various Exercism problems can be found here.
