# Language Learning
This is my place for learning new programming languages: taking notes, writing down concepts, re-explaining things to myself, storing useful resources, guides, tutorials, references, and anything else related to learning new and interesting programming languages that catch my eye, as well as serving as a useful knowledge base and area to practice for languages I already know.

## Exercism 
[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is an online learning platform used for programming language practice, in the form of bite sized programming problems (exercises), ranging from easy to hard. The nature of these problems place more emphasis on the language itself rather then the problem, with the problem serving as a vehicle to introduce you to new concepts and language features, rather than as a means to practice language agnostic problem solving like with LeetCode.

My solutions to various Exercism problems can be found in the exercism/ folder.
