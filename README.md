# Language Learning
This is my place for learning new programming languages, serving as a useful knowledge base for me to use as a reference; I store knowledge and examples here, as I explore new programming languages, or discover things worth keeping in languages that I already know.

## [Conceptual](conceptual/)
The conceptual directory contains theoretical and conceptual resources on learning a given programming language, including but not limited to guides, references, coverage of specific topics, articles, books, tutorials, courses, etc. It's also where I keep personal notes on certain programming languages, and re-explain things to myself to validate what I know (rubber duck learning, if you'd like), for future reference.

## [Practical](practical/)
The practical directory contains practical examples and exercises for a given programming language, meant for things like Exercism, LeetCode, and things of that nature, alongside examples of my own that illustrate certain language features.
