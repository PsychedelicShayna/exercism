# Exercism Solution Repository
[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is an online learning platform used for programming language practice, in the form of bite sized programmiong problems (exercises), ranging from easy to hard. The nature of these problems are quite different to those found on LeetCode or CodeForces, as they're centered around the language itself rather than the problem, with the problem primarily serving as a vehicle to learn more about the language and solidify your understanding of it; the problems themselves aren't really the main attraction.

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the various programming problems hosted on Exercism. On the master branch (current), you won't find any code, as each language is separated into its own branch. Select the corresponding language branch to see actual solutions.

In addition to hosting solutions to Exercism problems, each branch may contain additional resources, source code notes, guides, or educationally relevant information for that particular programming language.
